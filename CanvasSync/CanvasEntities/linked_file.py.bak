CanvasSync by Mathias Perslev

--------------------------------------------

Implements a class representing files not located on the Canvas server
Initialization of this object thus does not require a info dictionary as is the case for all classes representing true
Canvas entities. Instead, LinkedFile should be initialized with a direct download link.
However, the LinkedFile is derived from the base entity class and the walk, sync and show methods are implemented
and should be used in a similar fashion to other CanvasEntities objects.

An Assignment object is the parent object.

See developer_info.txt file for more information on the class hierarchy of CanvasEntities objects.
