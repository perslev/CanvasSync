page, CanvasEntity Class

The Page class stores information on HTML pages hosted on the Canvas server. It represents an end point in the hierarchy
and contains no child objects. When the sync method is invoked the HTML pages will be downloaded or skipped depending on
if it is already present in at the sync path. The HTML page will be appended with the title of the page along with a
URL pointing to the live version of the HTML page on the server.

A Module or SubHeader object is the parent object.

See developer_info.txt file for more information on the class hierarchy of CanvasEntities objects.
