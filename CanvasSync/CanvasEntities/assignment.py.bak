assignment.py, CanvasEntity Class

The Assignment class stores a list of child File objects and creates HTML pages representing the assignment description.
It is one level below the parent container AssignmentsFolder class and inherits from the Entity base class.

An AssignmentsFolder object is the parent object.

See developer_info.txt file for more information on the class hierarchy of CanvasEntities objects.
