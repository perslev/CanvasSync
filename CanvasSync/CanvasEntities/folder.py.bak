folder.py, CanvasEntity Class

The Folder class represents the top level 'Files' section in Canvas or a sub-folder here-off. The object is a container
of other Folder objects as well as Files objects. Recursion is used to map the Folder hierarchy of the 'Files' section.

A Course or Folder object is the parent object.

See developer_info.txt file for more information on the class hierarchy of CanvasEntities objects.
