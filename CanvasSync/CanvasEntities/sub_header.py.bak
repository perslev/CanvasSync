sub_header.py, Third level class in hierarchy

The SubHeader class is a container very similar to the Module object and it has a Module object as parent.
It inherits from the base Module class and extends its slightly by adding the ability to instantiate with a
dictionary of file information that does not need downloading from the Canvas server.
All other functionality is identical to the Module object. The SubHeader contains File, ExternalUrl and Page objects.

A Module class is the parent object.

See developer_info.txt file for more information on the class hierarchy of CanvasEntities objects.
