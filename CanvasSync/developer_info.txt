CanvasSync as a package was developed to function in a end-user application perspective and is not optimized for general
usage.

CanvasSync is implemented as a collection of classes structures in a hieararchy reflecting the structure of the
Canvas server closely. Canvas is a collection of various container 'entities' such as modules, assignments, folders etc.
that may contain items such as files, HTML pages and URLs.

The most important container objects are listed below:

- Courses, represented by the Course object is the highest level representation in the Canvas server. It stores
  all information on the course such as modules, files, assignments, grades, messages etc.
- Modules, represented by the Modules object, are folder like structures organizing files, HTML pages and links to
  external sites for a given course. The course Math 101 may for instance have a module called "Calculus" holding
  various files and pages upload by the teacher
- Subheaders, represented by the SubHeader class are sub folder like structures that separate items in modules into
  sub categories.
- Assignments, represented by the AssignmentsFolder is a collection of assignments under a course
- The Files section is a folder of files represented by the Folder object that may recursively represent the folder
  hieararchy of the Canvas Files section.


In CanvasSync, the same structure is followed at least to some degree. A collection of CanvasEntities objects are
organized into a hierarchy of levels displayed below. Most objects contain a list of child objects and one parent object:

At the very top we have a Synchronizer class that stores a list of Course child objects. The Synchronizer initializes
the sync by propagating a sync method call to all its children. This sync call propagates all the way to the level of
individual files, HTML pages, URLs and linked files (see below) that will not contain child objects ending the sync. The
same process is used to walk the hierarchy mapping out the structure without downloading and printing the hierarchy.

The Course object may hold both Module, Folder and AssignmentFolder objects.

The Module object contains Files, HTML pages and ExternalURLs all representing hierarchy end points that must
be downloaded from the server. The Module object may also contain SubHeader objects that are similar to the Module
object (SubHeader inherits most of its features from the Module class) that likewise contains File, Page and ExternalUrl
child classes.

The Folder object represent the 'Files' section of Canvas. This section actually stores most of the Files found across
other Canvas entities, but CanvasSync prioritises to put Items into Modules and Assignments to keep things organized.
With the default settings, items that are already present in Modules or Assignments will therfore not be added to the
Folder class.

The AssignmentsFolder is a basic container of Assignemnt objects. The Assignment objects represents individual assignments
in a course. The assignment description is downloaded into a HTML file and all files that are linked to in the description
will also be downloaded, either through the File object (for Canvas hosted files) or the LinkedFile objects (for
externally hosted files.)

NOTE: In almost all cases the CanvasEntity objects is initialized with the raw JSON dictionary of information on the
Canvas object of interest that was downloaded in the previous level. For instance, a Course object will contact the
server and recieve a list of dictionaries of information on Module objects. For each dictionary a Module object is
initialized.


BASE CLASS: ENTITY
------------------
All Classes inherit directly (or indirectly through the Module class for the SubHeader class) which is a basic class
holding information that is needed across all CanvasEntitiy objects. This information include: ID numbers, names,
synchronization path (absolute path to the objects physical location in the local folder), a list of child objects etc.


SETTINGS
--------
The CanvasSync application is initialized with a Settings object that holds information required to run the sync process
(the top level sync path, the Canvas server domain, the authentication token, list of courses that should be synced)
as well as other user defined settings.

UNICODE
-------
CanvasSync is implemented to use mostly Unicode.
